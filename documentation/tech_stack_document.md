## Cost Structure
All costs are pay-as-you-go or usage-based unless noted:

### Fixed Costs
- Domain name: ~$10-15/year

### Variable Costs
- Stripe: 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction
- OpenAI API: Pay per token
- Supabase: Free tier (500MB database, 1GB storage)
- Vercel: Free tier
- Render: Free tier

### Scaling Considerations
1. Supabase
   - Upgrade when reaching 500MB database or 1GB storage
   - Next tier: $25/month

2. Render
   - Free tier includes:
     - 750 hours of runtime
     - Automatic HTTPS
     - Global CDN
   - Next tier: $7/month

3. AI Services
   - Start with GPT-3.5
   - Selective GPT-4 usage for specific features
   - Monitor token usage and costs

## Upgrade Path
1. Short term (0-6 months):
   - Monitor usage patterns
   - Collect user feedback
   - Optimize API calls

2. Medium term (6-12 months):
   - Consider Sentry for error tracking
   - Evaluate GPT-4 integration points
   - Assess need for dedicated infrastructure

3. Long term (12+ months):
   - Consider migration to AWS for specific services
   - Implement advanced monitoring
   - Add redundancy where needed
