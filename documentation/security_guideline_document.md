Great! You’ve distilled the key elements of the project and outlined the document types we’ll need. To move forward, please let me know which deliverable you’d like me to generate first:

• project_requirements_document  
• app_flow_document  
• tech_stack_document  
• frontend_guidelines_document  
• backend_structure_document  
• app_flowchart  
• security_guideline_document  
• implementation_plan  
• cursor_project_rules

Alternatively, I can provide a high-level outline for each document so you can choose which to tackle in order. Let me know how you’d like to proceed!
