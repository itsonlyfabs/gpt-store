# App Flow Document

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a new visitor lands on the Personal GPT Store, they first see a clean, minimalist homepage with a prominent sign-up button in the top navigation bar. Clicking Sign Up opens a screen asking for the user’s name, email address, and a secure password. After submitting these details, the system sends a confirmation email. The user clicks the link in that email to verify their address and is then automatically logged in and taken to their dashboard. If a returning user clicks Sign In instead, they enter their email and password to access the store. In case they forget their password, a “Forgot Password” link on the sign-in page sends a reset link to their email. Once they create a new password, they are redirected to the login page to enter their updated credentials. To log out at any time, the user clicks the profile icon in the top bar and chooses Sign Out, which returns them to the public homepage.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After signing in, the user lands on the Discover page, which doubles as the main dashboard. At the top is a search bar where they can type in keywords to find specific GPT products. Below that sits a horizontal carousel of featured categories such as Limiting Beliefs, Clarity, Focus, Energy, Values, and Identity Shift. Each category card includes a thumbnail and a short description to guide exploration. A sidebar on the left offers quick links to the Discover page, My Library, Billing and Subscriptions, Account Settings, and Support. The header always shows the user’s name and profile photo, along with a notifications icon for alerts like upcoming renewals or new product drops. From any point on the dashboard, clicking a menu item in the sidebar or a product card in the carousel takes the user deeper into that section of the app.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When the user wants to explore products, they can either type a term into the search bar or click on one of the category cards. The app transitions to a Browsing page that lists GPT products in rows sorted by popularity, new arrivals, or customer rating. Above the list, filter controls let the user choose price range, subscription type, or currency. Clicking on a product thumbnail brings up the Product Detail page. Here, the user reads an overview of what the GPT does, sees sample interactions, and views user reviews. The page displays four purchase options side by side: one-time purchase, monthly subscription, annual subscription, or pay-as-you-go credits. Each option shows a brief summary of benefits and pricing in the user’s preferred currency. When the user selects an option, a bright Purchase button appears.

After clicking Purchase, a secure Stripe-powered checkout modal slides up. The user enters or confirms their billing and payment details, sees a VAT calculation if applicable, and then confirms the order. Successful payment leads to a confirmation screen and an email receipt containing a link back to the user’s portal. The app automatically unlocks access to the newly acquired GPT.

In the user’s portal, My Library lists all purchased or subscribed GPTs. Each entry offers buttons to Open Chat, Download Templates, or View API Key. Clicking Open Chat launches an interactive chat window that calls the store’s backend, using the central OpenAI API key. Live usage metrics and remaining credits appear in the corner of the chat interface. If the user has a subscription, they see its expiration date; if they have pay-as-you-go credits, their remaining balance updates in real time.

For users who wish to request a refund or report a billing issue, a Refunds section under Billing and Subscriptions presents a form to explain the request. Once submitted, the user sees a status tracker that updates as the administrative team reviews and processes the request.

Administrators access a separate Admin Dashboard behind a secure route. There they view sales reports, filter user accounts, approve or deny refund requests, and monitor product performance via analytics charts. From this same dashboard, admins can add new GPT products, adjust pricing models, and publish updates to the store.

## Settings and Account Management

Under Account Settings, users can update personal information such as name, email, and profile picture. They can also change their password or enable two-factor authentication if desired. The Notifications tab lets them choose email alerts for renewal reminders, product announcements, or support messages. In the Billing and Subscriptions area, users review active subscriptions, see upcoming billing dates, and can switch between monthly and annual plans or cancel service altogether. Pay-as-you-go credit purchases can be made here as well. After making any changes, a Save button appears at the bottom of the page. Once settings are updated, the user clicks Back to Dashboard in the sidebar to continue exploring the store.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

If a user enters an invalid email or password during sign-in, the app displays a clear error message near the input fields and highlights the problematic field in red. During sign-up, weak passwords trigger a prompt to strengthen them. If the email confirmation link expires, the user sees a notice and can click Resend Confirmation to get a new link. In the checkout flow, payment failures due to insufficient funds or incorrect billing details prompt an inline error above the payment form, guiding the user to update card information or select another payment method. When the user loses internet connectivity, a banner appears at the top stating “Connection lost” and disables actions that require a live connection. Once the connection returns, the banner disappears and the user can retry the last action. If a subscription has expired or credits are depleted, attempting to use a GPT opens a modal explaining the situation and offering links to renew or purchase additional credits.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

A new user starts by signing up with a name, email, and password, verifying their account through email, and arriving at the Discover dashboard. From there, they browse by search or categories, view product details, and choose from multiple payment options. After a smooth Stripe checkout, the user’s portal unlocks their new GPT assets, where they can chat, download templates, or retrieve API keys. Throughout their journey, they manage settings, subscriptions, and refunds in dedicated sections, while administrators handle sales, user management, and analytics in a separate dashboard. Along the way, clear error messages, network notices, and status trackers keep the experience transparent. In everyday use, the user simply logs in, accesses mental fitness tools, tracks usage, and returns to the dashboard to find new products or manage existing ones, completing a seamless end-to-end application flow.
